# Arduino-Ehternet-L239D-Robot
At the time of posting this i have not tested the code as i currently do not have the required set up.
The code presented is a combination of my Arduino Controlled L239D-Robot and my Arduino Ethernt project.
The logic seems to make sense and in theory should work.
Once i have the required set up i will update the code if i find any mistakes.
